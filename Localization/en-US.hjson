			Physicist: {
				PhysicsGun: This zero point energy field manipulator sees common use in laboratories. It excels in handling large objects or hazardous materials.
				PortalGun: This quantum tunneling device allows you to open seamless gateways through space. It is how I arrived here in the first place!
				GravityGlobe: Flipping this device upside down will reverse its holder's local gravity. It is disguised as a simple decorative object for ease of transport.
				LaserReticle: Designed for training in medical and nanotech work, these gloves reward their wearer for making accurate operations.
				HaltingMachine: This device neutralizes local gravity on small objects. Useful for those accustomed to working in zero gravity.
				HolographicMeatloaf: Popular with photosynthetic species. This meatloaf is projected with only the highest-quality light.

				BloodMoonStarter: I discovered this artifact while doing research on a "blood moon". The watery crystal at its core contains high amounts of an unknown energy.
				GalacticStarfruit: The energy readings from this fruit are nearly identical to those observed during a "glimmer". I recommend you use with caution.
				SolarTablet: I discovered this artifact while exploring underground in this island's lush areas. Scans indicate an unusual concentration of dark energy within.

				PylonGunnerItem: When deployed near a pylon, this drone will autonomously defend against any hostile lifeforms within range.
				PylonHealerItem: When deployed near a pylon, this drone will autonomously provide care to any injured citizens within range.
				PylonCleanserItem: When deployed near a pylon, this drone will autonomously repel any parasitic superorganisms within range.
					
				ForceAntiGravityBlock: This advanced platform projects a beam of reversed gravity that counters natural downwards force. Designed to increase usable area in factories.
				ForceGravityBlock: This advanced platform will enforce a standard gravity setting and counteract all opposite forces. Designed for use on spaceships.
				PhysicsBlock: This material was designed to absorb all energies that attempt to act upon it. As a result, it cannot be manipulated by the Physics Gun.
				EmancipationGrill: This semi-transparent particle field will vaporize any unauthorized material that passes through it. Designed to destroy contraband automatically, but may detect false positives on teeth or inner ears.

				SupernovaFruit: This apple is emitting incredible amounts of radiation. I project that handling it without sufficient protective gear would reduce your lifespan to about 2.5 minutes.
				
				ExLydSpacePainting: This mural seems to depict a spacefaring race I have not heard of before. Perhaps I should investigate them after my business is concluded here.
				HomeworldPainting: A speculative depiction of the Starite homeworld. Unfortunately, it is too far away for me to teleport there and confirm.

				BalloonKit: Jealous of my digs, huh? Why not buy your very own hot air balloon?
				Pumpinator: Bought this one off an airship crew. It's super helpful for navigating; just point it where you want the wind to go!
				Nimrod: Lightning striking a lake can kill hundreds of fish, but best I can do is three. Maybe the wizard who made this was concerned about the trout population?
				FlashwayNecklace: Crafted by a master thundersmith, this jewelry will grant lightning-fast reflexes to dodge any attack!
				NameTag: A lower-tech alternative to sticking label maker tags on your pets. I can imbue a name into it for you to use!

				EquippedAcc: Hmm... that accessory you've got is a nice one for sure, but maybe I can pique your interest with this?
				Banners: Trophies and rugs are a bit... brutish for my tastes. How about a more symbolic representation of mass slaughter?

				BongBongPainting: This abstract painting seems to depict some sort of creature. Are you the kind of person that would want this on your wall?
				CatalystPainting: Whoever came up with this piece must've not been fond of the Lunar Cult. Which, you know, fair!
				YinYangPainting: Light and dark, coexisting in harmony. Do you think it could ever happen?
				YinPainting: They say this piece depicts the ancient spirit of dark. Wonder which poor sap had to get it to pose for a portrait.
				YangPainting: They say this piece depicts the ancient spirit of light. Speaking of, I've been flying through a lot more rainbows lately...
				SkyrimRocks: This stone is carved with an ancient dragon language. Sadly, I haven't yet found anyone who can translate it...
				AncientBreakdownDye: Guaranteed to be the best dye to use at EDM raves, or your money back... if you can find me again!
				CensorDye: They use this all the time on TV shows! ...what do you mean, 'editing'?
				OutlineDye: You'll always be the center of attention with a giant white border around your clothes!
				ScrollDye: Apparently this lets you get in touch with your 'inner spritesheet'. No clue what that's supposed to mean.
				SimplifiedDye: This mix blends colors together, great for hiding bruises or blemishes and smoothing out unsightly attire.
				AncientHueshiftDye: This is a similar formula to rainbow dyes, but it shifts the colors already on your gear instead of applying its own.
				TornadoInABottle: Found this thing on a sky island recently. I'm not a fan of how violently it's rattling, so if you could take it off my hands that'd be great.
