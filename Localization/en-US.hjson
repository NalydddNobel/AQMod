			Guide.Glimmer: Do you see these lights? That glow heralds the arrival of living stars. Try heading for its origin and see what you can find!
			Merchant.Glimmer: I think this glittering night would reflect wonderfully off of your coins! Why not try it out, eh?
			Nurse.Glimmer: Oh, this is a wonderful sight. I've always loved the little beauties the world has hidden away, but it looks like this one decided to come to me!
			Demolitionist.Glimmer: When I was a little- well, littler lad, I wanted to visit the stars, but dwarves won't fly so high. Nowadays I'm content with just seeing 'em shine like this.
			DyeTrader.Glimmer: Those colors... magnificent! If you can find a dye recipe that recreates that glow you simply must share it with me!

			Angler: {
				LegendaryFishReward: Thanks LOSER! You have no clue about the power of this thing, don't you?
				LegendaryFish: Hey, HEY! I see that Legendary Fish you have on you. You think I can have it if I give you some shiny reward?
			}

			Dryad.Glimmer: What are these lights? I've never seen anything like it in all my years...
			ArmsDealer.Glimmer: Think I saw a rainbow sword out there. Why's it always swords, huh? Can't we have ancient gun shrines or something for once?
			DD2Bartender.Glimmer: I'm not normally one for mixing fancy drinks, but this sky's stirring some inspiration. How about a Starite Special?
			Stylist.Glimmer: Hmm... I'm in the mood to practice my gradients tonight. Do you mind possibly looking a little silly for a while, hun?
			GoblinTinkerer.Glimmer: See, that's what I'm talking about! The other goblins wouldn't care at all for a sight like this. I'm glad you guys have some taste.
			WitchDoctor.Glimmer: The sky's glow may seem serene, but bright colors in nature are a deadly warning. Take caution tonight, my friend.
			PartyGirl.Glimmer: Wow, it's like the sky's having a party too! I wish it could look like this every night!
			Wizard.Glimmer: Wait, the sky... oh beanstalks, did I leave that spell going?
			TaxCollector.Glimmer: All those glittery lights... reminds me of the holidays. Bah.
			Truffle.Glimmer: I feel... something from the stars tonight. I'm not sure it's a good something, either.
			Pirate.Glimmer: Red sky at night, sailors' delight... err, what does blue-n'-purple sky at night mean?
			SantaClaus.Glimmer: Oh ho, this sky is wonderful! Just like the auroras at the North Pole!
			Princess.Glimmer: The sky tonight is simply mesmerizing! It reminds me of the light shows they would hold at the castle...
			TravellingMerchant.Glimmer: What a beautiful shine in the sky tonight! If it looks like this all the time here, I'll have to stay the night more often!
			SkeletonMerchant.Glimmer: I keep hearing thuds from above, like something's hitting the ground really hard. What are you folks doing up there?
			BestiaryGirl.Glimmer: The sky's totally nice and all, but I just hope the falling stars don't hurt any critters...
			Painter.Glimmer: The way the colors blend together... it's like a nebula in my own backyard! Talk about inspirational!
			Golfer.Glimmer: Now there's a backdrop to end all backdrops. Too bad golfing's mostly about staring at the ground.
			Clothier.Glimmer: You see quite a few things living a life like mine, but this sky is definitely one of the ones I wouldn't mind a repeat of.
			Mechanic.Glimmer: I wonder... you think this star power would make for a good green energy source?
			Steampunker.Glimmer: Cor, now that's a sight! Far cry from the dreary weather where I come from, I'll tell you what.
			Cyborg.Glimmer: I theorize that these atmospheric lights are caused by interference from anomalous energies related to the Starites.
