				PhysicsGun: This zero point energy field manipulator sees common use in laboratories. It excels in handling large objects or hazardous materials.
				PortalGun: This quantum tunneling device allows you to open seamless gateways through space. It is how I arrived here in the first place!
				GravityGlobe: Flipping this device upside down will reverse its holder's local gravity. It is disguised as a simple decorative object for ease of transport.
				LaserReticle: Designed for training in medical and nanotech work, these gloves reward their wearer for making accurate operations.
				HaltingMachine: This device neutralizes local gravity on small objects. Useful for those accustomed to working in zero gravity.
				HolographicMeatloaf: Popular with photosynthetic species. This meatloaf is projected with only the highest-quality light.
				BloodMoonStarter: I discovered this artifact while doing research on a "blood moon". The watery crystal at its core contains high amounts of an unknown energy.
				GalacticStarfruit: The energy readings from this fruit are nearly identical to those observed during a "glimmer". I recommend you use with caution.
				SolarTablet: I discovered this artifact while exploring underground in this island's lush areas. Scans indicate an unusual concentration of dark energy within.

				SupernovaFruit: This apple is emitting incredible amounts of radiation. I project that handling it without sufficient protective gear would reduce your lifespan to about 2.5 minutes.
				ExLydSpacePainting: This mural seems to depict a spacefaring race I have not heard of before. Perhaps I should investigate them after my business is concluded here.

				BalloonKit: Jealous of my digs, huh? Why not buy your very own hot air balloon?
				Pumpinator: Bought this one off an airship crew. It's super helpful for navigating; just point it where you want the wind to go!
				Nimrod: Lightning striking a lake can kill hundreds of fish, but best I can do is three. Maybe the wizard who made this was concerned about the trout population?
				FlashwayNecklace: Crafted by a master thundersmith, this jewelry will grant lightning-fast reflexes to dodge any attack!
				NameTag: A lower-tech alternative to sticking label maker tags on your pets. I can imbue a name into it for you to use!
				EquippedAcc: Hmm... that accessory you've got is a nice one for sure, but maybe I can pique your interest with this?

				ScrollDye: Apparently this lets you get in touch with your 'inner spritesheet'. No clue what that's supposed to mean.
				SimplifiedDye: This mix blends colors together, great for hiding bruises or blemishes and smoothing out unsightly attire.
				AncientHueshiftDye: This is a similar formula to rainbow dyes, but it shifts the colors already on your gear instead of applying its own.

				Meathook: I managed to steal this from my arch-enemy's arsenal just before I left. If he finds out where I am, I'm doomed...
				ShadowKey: This key will open the infernal treasures in the deepest recesses of the earth. Luckily for you, demonite is much more durable than gold.
				UnholyCore: I found this artifact in the sixth circle. It can siphon away incredible amounts of evil magic!
				SpiritBottle: Maybe those ghosts are just cranky! I would be too if I was dead! Think you could calm them down with a nice drink?
				BlackPhial: The liquid within is concocted from pure black magic. Even a single drop will make a pigron deathly ill.
				GoreNest: This mound of meat serves as none other than a gateway to Oblivion! Be careful where you place it, my friend...
				GoreNestPainting: I made this painting myself! Always nice to try new hobbies. I had a lot of fun sourcing the red paint in particular~
				InsurgentPainting: This painting depicts what'll happen to you if you keep associating with me! Hahahahaha!

				MagicMissile: I hear this is good at fighting darkness. I don't want it. You take it.
				Revenant: Hey, do you like ghosts? I like ghosts. This staff can make ghosts for us, then we can both be happy. That's a two-for-one deal.
				CobaltShield: An enchanted shield that will keep you rooted to the spot... all the better for spells to catch you inside. Hypothetically, of course.
				BlueMoon: I haven't got the strength for it, but this is one of my favorite weapons in concept. Who needs subtlety when you can just cave skulls in?
				Muramasa: Some people say this dusty old thing holds some kind of ancient power. NOT to be confused with Murasama, or Masamune, or any of that nonsense.
				DungeonCandle: I found another candle kicking around somewhere! Great for lighting a romantic dinner, if you're feasting on souls.
				Valor: How on earth do people do all those fancy tricks with these? I can barely get it to bounce back up into my hand!
				Valari: This boomerang is enchanted with wind magic that can drag stuff with it, or whatever. I'll be honest, if it's not fire or darkness I do not care at all.
