Sky Merchant:
- Resprited.
- Now spawns at the very left side of the world during the day, and slowly travels to the right side of the world, following the Sun. This should hopefully make the Sky Merchant more consistent and easily available to players who want to purchase items from them.
- Completely revitalized shop, featuring many new items!
- Ported the Balloon Kit, with a visual enhancement, and slightly improved stats.
- New Item: Calendar, displays how many days have passed, and which day of the week it is.
- New Item: Sky Hunter's Crossbow, want to fight in space without losing all of your ammo or having items drop to the ground? This crossbow both returns your arrows and picks up items dropped by enemies!
- New Item: Slimy Blue Balloon, decreases your falling speed. Slightly different from featherfall, as this does not reduce your gravity when moving upwards, making it not increase your jump height.
- New Item: Weighted Horseshoe, increases your falling speed. Allows you to fall through and damage enemies at a high enough speed.
- New Item: Flashway Shield, grants a dash, slightly longer than the Shield of Cthulhu but cannot bonk on enemies.

	-- Combines with the Band of Regeneration to create the Golden Wind, granting more life regeneration.
- New Item: Stun Gun, allows you to stun enemies, making them heavily vulnerable.
- New Item: Furystar, reminiscent of the orignal Starfury! Using mana and all! (Well, it deals magic damage now.)
