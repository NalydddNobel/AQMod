Sky Merchant:
- Resprited.
- Now spawns at the very left side of the world during the day, and slowly travels to the right side of the world, following the Sun. This should hopefully make the Sky Merchant more consistent and easily available to players who want to purchase items from them.

- New Item: Calendar, displays how many days have passed, and which day of the week it is.

- New Item: Slimy Blue Balloon, decreases your falling speed. Slightly different from featherfall, as this does not reduce your gravity when moving upwards, making it not increase your jump height.

- New Item: Flashway Shield, grants a dash, slightly longer than the Shield of Cthulhu but cannot bonk on enemies.
