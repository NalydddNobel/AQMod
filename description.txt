[c/7EC8E3:Overview]
Aequus is a project full of experimental features and content, woven together into a singular experience. We make this mod for fun, and take a lot of inspiration from other games, mods, shows, and other stuff.
Most of the content is before Plantera, don't expect to see much after that point.
