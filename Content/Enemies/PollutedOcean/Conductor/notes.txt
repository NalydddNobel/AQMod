check the .ase file to see what frame does what in where for what in where

last 2 frames are the same for timing but if you want you can cut the last

wave goes around the antenna head when 'charging' an attack



you can do gores ifyou want, or not idontremember if skeletons and casters leave gores



oh yea i dont know if the wave should have a glowmask, would contrast too much with
the actual enemy having no glow, maybe could be a translusent glowmask? is that athing?
